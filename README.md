QuantumVITAS (Quantum Visualization Interacting Toolkit for Ab-initio Simulations) is a graphical user interface designed for ab-initio simulation software Quantum ESPRESSO, aiming at making ab-initio simulations easily accessible and intuitively controllable in various operating systems. It integrates input file generation, calculation job control, result analysis and data managment into a user interface. In the future we might integrate other engines besides Quantum ESPRESSO.
