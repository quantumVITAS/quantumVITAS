# QuantumVITAS

QuantumVITAS (Quantum Visualization Interacting Toolkit for Ab-initio Simulations) is a graphical user interface designed for ab-initio simulation software Quantum ESPRESSO, aiming at making ab-initio simulations easily accessible and intuitively controllable in various operating systems.

We want to integrate input file generation, calculation job control, result analysis and data managment into the user interface. In the future we may integrate other engines besides Quantum ESPRESSO.

The project is **not done yet**, and we are continuously working on it. We expect to offer the first early access version in **mid June**. For more information, feel free check out my [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2e1TWx6DHs) and [development progress video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSX576IHaH0) on my Youtube channel.
