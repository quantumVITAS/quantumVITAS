QuantumVITAS (Quantum Visualization Interacting Toolkit for Ab-initio Simulations) is a graphical user interface designed for ab-initio simulation software Quantum ESPRESSO, aiming at making ab-initio simulations easily accessible and intuitively controllable in various operating systems. It integrates input file generation, calculation job control, result analysis and data managment into a user interface. In the future we might integrate other engines besides Quantum ESPRESSO.

## Download releases 

The project is actively evolving, and we have offered [the first three early access releases](https://github.com/quantumVITAS/quantumVITAS/releases/) with detailed feature lists. We appreciate any bug report or suggestion for feature implementation for the next step. A guide of [download](https://www.quantumvitas.org/download/) and [quick start](https://www.quantumvitas.org/quick-start/) can be found in the official website.

## Requirements

*   Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8: https://java.com/en/download/
*   Windows/Linux/Mac OS

## Highlighted features

Please refer to the [release page](https://github.com/quantumVITAS/quantumVITAS/releases/) for a detailed feature list. We would like to highlight the following features below:
* Calculations implemented:
    * Self-consistency (SCF)
        * Magnetism and spin orbital coupling (SOC)
        * DFT+U
        * Hybrid functionals
        * Van der Waals corrections
    * Structural optimization/relaxation (OPT)
    * Density of states (DOS)
    * Band structure (including spin polarized and SOC)
    * Molecular dynamics (Bornâ€“Oppenheimer MD)
    * Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT)
    * Phonon (gamma point, DOS, dispersion, raman, dielectric constant)
    * NEB (Nudged Elastic Band) for transition energy barrier calculation
    * Projection to atomic orbitals (to each atom or to each element, also in the spin polarized case and SOC)
        * Projected DOS calculation
        * Projected band structure (fat bands)
* Parallel/multicore computing supported (both openmp and mpirun) and job control
* Visualizations:
    * 3D viewer
    * Visualizations of the output of all calculations
